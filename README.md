# UFOs
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to create a website to help give curious minds the ability to filter through 100's of different UFO sightings. Although this is shocking to people there are plenty of sightings that people arent aware of. So giving people the option to filter through there states, cities even countries. Some people will even be intrigued by the many shapes that are caught. 
## Results
Upon opening the website you get a page with a lot of information on it and it can seem a bit overwhelming. However, that is what the filters are for. There are a few filters here that you can choose between such as City, State, Country even the date. Some may want to see if any special event happened on their birthdays. There are definitely some strange sightings, some people couldnt even describe the shape. Looking here there are quite a few that have an unknown shape size. Seems they were too excited to describe the haspe specifically.

Looking at the picture above you can see that we have ve done a multi-search and it really gets precise. Weve done a search for a triangle shape, in california that has occured on 01/9/2010. With the ability to search for more than one thing at onece is very helpfull on pinpointing specific/ special events.

## summary 
Looking at the website not everything is perfect. What if someone wanted to see a photo of that sighting, if one is available? Having some of the photos of the sighting will create more excitement and have more people looking at the website. Some recommendations to furthre develop the website would be to have a different background instead of the plai black. Maybe a picture of one of the sightings or a galaxy background. Another recommendation is to possibly have a link to go to a news article/publishing of the sighting. This would be able to give more information of what happened that instance and if there are connected sightings with footage from different angles.
